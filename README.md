# Gitmatch

GitMatch aims to help students like us network with other developers and find hackathon teammates. With an easy to use UI, a user can login to the app, complete their profile and start finding other devs.
Say suppose someone is good at frontend and needs a partner whoâ€™s good at backend. They can easily use our filters to get a stack of profiles that match their needs and go through them until they find their match. As an additional feature for premium users, they can use our resume-ranker. Just by uploading their resume and a job description, our website will rank the resume on how suitable it is for the job. This is very essential in the modern day as many companies use ML tools to parse through applications, so it is essential to know how well our resumes keep up against these tools.
